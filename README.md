💭 Project - The project reflects my personal journey as a developer/engineer. Built in, I included my resume, projects that I have worked on, learnt from and collaborated with.

🎨 Features - The key features of this personal portfolio webpage is that it a website displaying my growth and journey into the tech industry from a financial background. From knowing almost absolutely nothing to developing, building and designing on my own.

📦 Tech Stack - The tech stack I used in this project was my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT!!! I implemented JavaScript.

🎯 The Process - I was advised by my Mentor to start thinking about putting a portfolio together. I had been thinking about this since I started my Tech journey so I was very excited to get started. I obviously had to wait until I knew how to program first before putting anything together.Until I got JavaScript under my belt did I finally decide to attempt my project. I must say, I think I did a very good job with only 3months of experience. I started with researching what type of website I would like and followed by colour and flow. Structure and form were inportant to me. It was also important to me to be able to display the concepts I learnt in the different programming too. Making this website responsive to the user was a must. UI/UX Design intentionally showeed up in the website as well. I decided to include a contact form in order for future employers and partners to be able to get hold of me. This was a cool touch as the information captured leads to my google sheet - contact form where I will receive a notification that it has been completed.

✏️Lessons Learnt - Prepare before hand what you are viualsing. This helps you prepare your tech stack and provided clearity during your design process. Then watching your work come together is a satisfing feeling.

📈 Areas of Improvement - Including a frame work would be ideal. As I only know and understand the fundamentals, exploring into an intermediate level would be great. This would allow me to showase more skill.

🧠 Overall Growth – From where I started, I have really progressed and am able to see the confidence that I have developed in this project.

🚦Running the Project – The website can be opened by clicking on the index.html file. This will open in your web browser. Then you are able to squizz through the my website .
